<h1>Active-Directory-Lab</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
This fun and straightforward home lab setup uses VirtualBox to create a virtual network environment featuring Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10. The lab focuses on Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) setup, including configuring NAT for internet access, a single DHCP scope for IP management, and leveraging PowerShell for creating 1000 users. It's a hands-on project to learn and practice AD concepts in a controlled, home-based environment.
